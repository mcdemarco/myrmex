## About

This is a JavaScript implementation of Myrmex, a solitaire game for the Decktet card system.  The Decktet was created by P.D. Magnus and released under a CC license.  Myrmex was created by Greg James; all of his variants are supported.

The JavaScript implementation is partly based on an implementation of Adaman by Felbrigg Herriot, who released it under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike 3.0 License.  Myrmex can be played in any browser (desktop or mobile), and will continue to work offline.

Games are automatically saved and restored; to start a new game press the New button.  To restart the same game without shuffling, press the Replay button.

## Why?

Myrmex is a Decktet version of Spider, which I wanted to be able to play even when there isn't room to spread out my double Decktet deck.

## Additional Features

Full rules are available under "Rules." Besides variants, save, restore, undo and replay (mentioned above), the following features can be set or changed in the settings:

* Enlarge the cards for tiny screens.
* "Black Moons" make Moons easier to distinguish from Knots.
* An anti-snooker setting shows you which courts and pawns you've already put into chambers.

## Bugs

Undo only undoes one move.  (Undoing again will re-do.)  Undo will not undo a deal.
